# netCDf_python
Workflow to Read, visualize, slice and convert netCDF(nc.) files in Python

The python workflow will read the netcdf file and the image arrays will be extracted and stored in Tiff format (IMGAGE J). The arrays can also be vizualized in Python as well as Ncview for Netcdf
The goal of the script is also to subsect the large datasets into smaller files and share it with data developers and researchers through Digital Rock Portal
